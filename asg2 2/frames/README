This directory will contain the frames generated to make a video.
You should test your frame generation to make sure that it works,
but do not submit a project with the frames generated because
the aggregation  of submissions will be too large.

To build the movie:
avconv -r 60 -i malloy.%4d.bmp malloy.mp4
