Project description: SDL sprite animation

The easiest part of this project: SDL_Rect was pretty easy to work with...simple x,y coordinates. Basic algebra helped with the animations.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Figuring out the best approach to create simple and effective classes. Deciding what classes to make and what to include in each kept me feeling there was always a better way to go as I was creating my classes etc.
